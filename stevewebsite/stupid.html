          <b>BALLER</b>

          a damn girlfriend, stop the cap.)

            I think its disgusting that somebody used my blindfolded M64 run and
            past it off as a tas to re-record themselves reacting to it. He also
            conveniently put his cam right over mine so you can't see me eating
            coke and drinking pizza at the same time. These "speedrunners" aka
            cheaters are getting out of hand. Thanks to my friend who told me
            about this blatant thievery of my OC. <u>Thanks badabun.</u></b

            i was totally looking forward to speedrunning wilson's prison, the
            hit new roblox scary obby game (but seriously it was so scared like
            i peed my pants and im 21 years old and i live in my parents
            basement! that's how scary it was and after it made me LOL which
            means laugh out loud for the uncultured swines that don't understand
            the language of the internet) but i find out there was no
            speedrun.com page! i panicked and my parents kept screaming at me
            and eventually kicked me out of the house, but fortunately
            buildergreenmlg751 came to the rescue and suggested the game for me

            This is an Eve clone. A poor one at that. Some problems that I have
            are... 1) They give you ships for mining and no working lasers to
            mine with. Why bother with mining ships if they don't work?. 2) The
            "jobs" are almost totally unusable do to the fact that, again, they
            make them undoable. 3) Trade in next to impossible so you can't make
            money. Fix these problems and you'll get more stars.
